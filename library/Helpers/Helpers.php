 * `vendor/`, that relative path no longer points at the consuming
 * application, so it's been removed. If your app has its own
 * `app/Helpers/*.php` files, autoload them from your app's own
 * composer.json instead, e.g.:
 *
 *   "autoload": {
 *     "files": ["app/Helpers/load.php"]
 *   }
 *
 * where `app/Helpers/load.php` globs and requires that directory.
